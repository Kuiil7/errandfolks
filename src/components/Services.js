    Errand Folks, how?
    </p>
    <p className="subtitle">
    Our ultimate goal is to keep this simple and sweet for all of you! First, you will need to send an email to <strong><a href="info@ErrandFolks.com">info@ErrandFolks.com</a></strong> that you need support.
    </p> <p className="subtitle">
       We will respond with a few questions (your location/what you need/where we find them/when need it) Then we will send out confidential information to our folks in your location to see who is available to help you. When we have an ErrandFolk ready to support you, they will be connected with you to work together to get your errands done.    </p>
