    <strong>What is ErrandFolks? </strong>
   Volunteers can safely help their communities by following this guide developed in accordance with your home state's Department of Public Health's safety guidelines while volunteering.


     </p>
<p className="subtitle">
  <strong>How does ErrandFolks work?</strong>
     Our ultimate goal is to keep this simple and sweet for all of you! First, you will need to send an email to <a href="info@ErrandFolks.com">info@ErrandFolks.com</a> that you need support. We will respond with a few questions (your location/what you need/where we find them/when need it) Then we will send out confidential information to our folks in your location to see who is available to help you. When we have an ErrandFolk ready to support you, they will be connected with you to work together to get your errands done.
     </p>

<p className="subtitle">
<strong>How does the payment work?</strong>
  There are two options. First, an ErrandFolk can pay for your items, then you reimburse them. The reimbursement can be via electronic transfer or cash, it will be decided between the client and ErrandFolk. Second option: the client pays in advance, then an ErrandFolk will share the receipt and reimburse the difference.
  </p>

<p className="subtitle">
  <strong>Do I have to pay for the service?</strong>
    No! It is 100% volunteer based service which means the volunteers are doing this for free. However, tips would be appreciated to cover expenses for gas.

I'm happy to know that you want to become a volunteer! It is simple and sweet, please send an email to <a href="info@ErrandFolks.com">info@ErrandFolks.com</a>  showing your interest to become a "folk" and we will be sending you a few questions form and have you filled it out.
