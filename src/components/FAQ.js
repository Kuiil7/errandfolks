    <p>   <strong>How does ErrandFolks work?</strong>
</p>
  </div>
  <div class="message-body">
  Our ultimate goal is to keep this simple and sweet for all of you! First, you will need to send an email to <a href="info@ErrandFolks.com">info@ErrandFolks.com</a> that you need support. We will respond with a few questions (your location/what you need/where we find them/when need it) Then we will send out confidential information to our folks in your location to see who is available to help you. When we have an ErrandFolk ready to support you, they will be connected with you to work together to get your errands done.

    <p>   <strong>How does the payment work?</strong>

</p>
  </div>
  <div class="message-body">
  There are two options. First, an ErrandFolk can pay for your items, then you reimburse them. The reimbursement can be via electronic transfer or cash, it will be decided between the client and ErrandFolk. Second option: the client pays in advance, then an ErrandFolk will share the receipt and reimburse the difference.

    <p>     <strong>Do I have to pay for the service?</strong>
</p>
  </div>
  <div class="message-body">
  No! It is 100% volunteer based service which means the volunteers are doing this for free. However, tips would be appreciated to cover expenses for gas.
